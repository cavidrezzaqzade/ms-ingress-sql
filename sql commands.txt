-- The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
--
-- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
-- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
-- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
-- FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables                                                                                                                        FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
-- CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
-- DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
-- CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
